# Evacuation-Simulation
This code is what I used to build my honors thesis.

<p>&emsp;The simulation was written in GAML which is available through GAMA platform (https://gama-platform.org/). GAML is similar to the Java programming language. This project has not yet been completed but will be finished within the month. </p>
